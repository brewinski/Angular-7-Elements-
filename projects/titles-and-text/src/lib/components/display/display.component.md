# Display Component

The display component is used to make big, bold, visual statements. Use them to create impact where a site heading is not needed.

---

## Best practices

The display component should:

- Be placed at the top of a page, or within a isolated banner, to draw the users attention.
- Use smaller caption text to support the message.
- Do not use it as a headings tool for site content.
